    "To solve this riddle, I will use Python 3.6 with the datetime module. First, I will assign the **`date`** variable to the first day of the first month of 2001 since the time period of interest is 2001 through 2099. I will then initiate the **`total_attacks`** variable, which will result in the total number of attacks during the time period of interest. I will then initiate the **`attacks_ea_year`** dictionary, which will include the number of attacks each year with each year serving as a key. I will then initiate the **`ea_attack`** list, which will include every datetime.date object meeting the criteria of month x date = two-digit year."
